## FIRST STEP
1. Place the `scientists` folder in the root directory of your server e.g For XAMPP that is htdocs, while for WAMP it is WWW. If it is hosted online then most hosts use public_html as the root directory.

## CREATING DATABASE TABLE
1. Create a database called scientistsdb
2. In PHPMyAdmin go Import --> Then select the `scientiststb_sql` file.
3. That file will create for you a table and fill it with initial data.
